# The Nexus Covenant

## Description
The Nexus Covenant are a collective of individuals who worship Entity-001, otherwise known as the Matriarch. The group's main objective is to bring about the event which they refer to as "The Convergence", being when all lifeforms on Earth are assimilated into Entity-001's Hive. Moreover, it is suppposed that successful catalysation of the Convergence will result in the group obtaining anomalous power of great magnitude from Entity-001. Evidently, most members of TNC have already begun partial assimilation into the Hive, with their bodies having different levels of mutation, and higher-ranking members being mutated to a higher degree.
