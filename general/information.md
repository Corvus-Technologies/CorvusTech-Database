# Company General Information

Corvus Technologies was founded during World War 2, under the name Raven Manufacturing.

The company had played a major, yet controversial role during the war by offering top-quality firearms and ammunition manufacturing services to both powers and practically every nation.

Of course, during early periods, clients were critical of the company's approach as we were also manufacturing for their enemies. However, as time went on clients began to be at war not only through literal means but additionally by fighting to be the company's highest bidder.
