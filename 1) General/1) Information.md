# Company General Information
## History
Corvus Technologies was founded during World War 2, under the name Raven Manufacturing.

The company had played a major, yet controversial role during the war by offering top-quality firearms and ammunition manufacturing services to both powers and practically every nation. However, not everyone had accepted the company's services.

Of course, during early periods, clients were critical of the company's approach as we were also willing manufacturing for their enemies. However, as time went on clients began to be at war not only through literal means but additionally by fighting to be the company's highest bidder.
