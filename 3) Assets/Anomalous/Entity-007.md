**Common Name:** [UNAVAILABLE]

**Containment Class:** 3

**Danger Class:** 4

## Description
Entity-007 is a creature with the ability to augment its appearance at will, or "shapeshift" in common terms. It is able to shift its appearance into a multitude of objects, from inanimate objects like furniture, to disguising itself as various species of fauna, including humans.

Entity-007 in its raw form has a deformed humanoid body, and is the size of an average human, and it is a facultative biped. Its appearance is similar to that of instances within Entity-001's Hive, and it is suspected that Entity-007 is a being of high importance within it. 

Entity-007 has its own entry as an Anomalous Asset, with the reasons being it was discovered by the company before we discovered the existance of the Hive, and Entity-007 is seemingly one-of-a-kind in the Hive heirarchy. The exact position of it within the heirarchy, however, is unknown.
