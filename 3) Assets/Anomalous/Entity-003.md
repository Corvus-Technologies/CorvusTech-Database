**Common Name:** Spore Raptor

**Containment Class:** 2

**Danger Class:** 1

## Description
Entity-003 is a semi-sapient, bipedal creature of reptile-like appearance. It is 3 studs in height and 6 studs in length, and has a smooth, turquoise, brittle exoskeleton with fungal growths. Entity-003's skin is black in colour, and is highly slippery.

Entity-003, while mortal, is capable of "reviving" itself. Upon death, spores are released from the mushrooms on Entity-003's back and its corpse will eventually disintegrate into more spores. These spores will disperse in a small cloud, and Entity-003 will be found alive once again in this cloud within several minutes. Currently, no harmful effects have been shown from inhaling these spores, however its effects require further study.

Furthermore, Entity-003 is highly skittish to the point where sudden loud noises such as gunshots cause it to collapse and expire. Despite this skittishness, it is absurdly poor at self-preservation, and acts similarly to a deer in headlights during the significant majority of perilous moments. While it is capable of running at high speeds, it is rarely seen running from danger and much more commonly runs while playing. 

## Containment Procedure
Entity-003 is kept in a 60 * 60 stud containment chamber with a simulated environment, featuring a grass floor and a large, artificial, climbable mushroom structure. A food bowl is to be provided to Entity-003, and should be refilled with any safely edible material on a bi-weekly basis.
