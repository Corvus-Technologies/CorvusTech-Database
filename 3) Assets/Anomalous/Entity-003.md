**Common Name:** Spore Raptor

**Containment Class:** 2

**Danger Class:** 1

## Description
Entity-003 is a semi-sapient, bipedal creature of reptile-like appearance. It is 3 studs in height and 6 studs in length, and has a smooth, turquoise, brittle exoskeleton with fungal growths, along with small, black scales.

Entity-003, while mortal, is capable of "reviving" itself. Upon death, spores are released from the mushrooms on Entity-003's back and its corpse will eventually disintegrate into more spores. These spores will disperse in a small cloud, and Entity-003 will be found alive once again in this cloud within several minutes. 

## Containment Procedure
Entity-003 is kept in a 60 * 60 stud containment chamber with a simulated environment, featuring a grass floor and a large, artificial, climbable mushroom structure. A food bowl, set of wooden building blocks, and collection of hats is to be provided to Entity-003. The food bowl should be refilled with any safely edible foodstuff on a bi-weekly basis.
